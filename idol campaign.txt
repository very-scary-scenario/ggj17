## earth_blur

It's the year 20XX.
After a gruelling war against an otherworldly threat, Earth is in a state of recovery.
A time of reflection, repair and respite.
With a sombre mood permeating the planet, the populace turns to entertainers to raise their spirits.

## office_bloom

This is the story of an idol unit that conquered the world.
With love.
And also music.
Our unit's humble beginning is in an office building in central Shin Tokyo.
It still lays in a state of disrepair following the attack, but it'll have to do.
People are desperate for encouragement from local idols, and it helps no one if the dances are sloppy.
For this idol unit to be successful, they must first learn from the girls that came before them.
Fortunately for us, there's a local group available to teach our girls in a hands-on way.

### clear
Charming.
This may just be the beginning, but our idol unit has what it takes to unite the world with cheer.
The quickest way to the top is to learn from those with similar aspirations, however...
...it also means that our rivals are standing in the way of this dream.
They must fight.

> battle 0

With the rival unit defeated, our heroes have taken their first steps towards saving the world.
Thank you, senpais.
Your spirits will live on in the new generation.

# part two

## small_stage_bloom

After learning some dance routines from the internet and squeezing in some karaoke sessions, our unit is ready for their stage debut.
From there we can show the rest of Shin Tokyo that their saviours have arrived.
To move forward they must perform at local venues, slowly working their way up the idol food chain.
Local venues with their tiny stages.
Sticky floors.
Cigarette stains.
...
Sigh.
But in these trying times, we must all make sacrifices.
It's 6pm. The local venue, Angel Sparking Dream, is soon to open its doors for the night's performance.
There's another idol group on the cards, but we should be able to convince them to give up their spot. 
### boss_2_2 enter, from left, into middle
boss_2_2:: "Who the heck are these clowns?"
boss_2_2:: "Security!"
### boss_2_1 enter, from left, into left
boss_2_1:: "Hey what's up"
### boss_2_2
boss_2_2:: "Not you, idiot. You don't even have a suit or a clipboard."
boss_2_2:: "SECURITY!"
### boss_2_3 enter, from right, into right
boss_2_3:: "I'm here!"
boss_2_2:: "You're barely an idol, let alone security."
boss_2_2:: "Honestly, where the heck are they?"
boss_2_3:: "On a date, boss. Nice place by the river."
boss_2_2:: "Phenomenal. It's lucky we're not paying them a wage."
"Looks like we'll be throwing you out this time."
This is our chance at a big break, and one that our heroes so desperately need.
Idols! Remove that rival idol unit fom their own gig and claim your rightful place as the hope of Shin Tokyo.

> battle 50

With the rival unit defeated, it's now up to us to achieve their dream.
It's quite beautiful, really. 
Even with the mess.
As crowds of people filter into the venue, they seem surprised to see a different idol group on the stage.
But surprise quickly turns to acceptance, as they wave their approval through the medium of glowstick.

# part three

## jp_alley_blur

While leaving the venue, the idols are approached by someone in a business suit.
They wanted to know if you'd seen the idols that were meant to be performing tonight.
Having no idea what they're talking about, it seems you aren't going to be of much use.
The rudimentary check behind the stage leaves them optionless, and it's decided that they will help our idols instead.
Not only do they have contacts at the Shin Nippon Budokan, the most important stage in the country,
but they'll also help with the cleaning! Score!
Seriously, when it comes to removing stains from your costume's frills, you need all the help you can get.
There is a condition, however.
Our idols are introduced to another local unit. One that seems to know this person. 
### boss_3_2 enter, from left, into middle
boss_3_2:: "Hey, back off. This person belongs to us."
### boss_3_1 enter, from left, into left
boss_3_1:: "We won them in an idol-off in the streets."
boss_3_1:: "We own them and their next two generations."
### boss_3_3 enter, from right, into right
boss_3_3:: "We don't know much about them, but the suit makes us seem more important."
boss_3_2:: "Now, how about some compensation?"
boss_3_2:: "You know, for the emotional trauma you've caused us today."
To win the help of this suit, our idols must demonstrate what the opportunity means to them.
The two groups dust down their costumes, assume their fighting stances and prepare for battle.

> battle 100

With the battle won, our idols are one step closer to conquering the world.
With love, sparkles and all that good stuff.
Business suit seems irritated that the other unit didn't learn their name,
but concludes that we're probably kinder and might learn it eventually.
With the dreams and aspirations of three rival idol units inside them, they head to the Shin Nippon Budokan. 

# part four

## budokan_glow

The producer proves to be a great asset almost immediately, gaining the idols access to the Budokan.
While under regular circumstances we'd have been granted access to the venue, we are somewhat expediting the process.
After all, while we know that these idols are going to become the saviours of the world, the general populace doesn't know that yet.
So it's not really our fault that the guards stood no chance against a powerful chop to the neck.
As our group approaches the stage, a famous idol unit slowly comes into view.
You know, /it's them/. The most popular idols in all of Shin Japan.
They aren't like the others, though. Their overwhelming presence is felt from across the corridor.
Worst still, they know why our unit is here.
### boss_4_2 enter, from left, into middle
boss_4_2:: "Another one? Seriously, these guards are an embarrassment to the Shin Budokan."
The leader of the group, without breaking eye contact with our idols, removes her evening gloves and tosses them to one side.
### boss_4_1 enter, from left, into left
boss_4_1:: "Lucky for them, I could use a warm up before this evening's performance."
This one pats her mouth with a tissue. It appears we're not the first to challenge them today.
### boss_4_3 enter, from right, into right
boss_4_3:: "These ones don't even /look/ like idols."
...
Unforgivable.
We can't rush this. That they are still hungry for battle is testament to their strength.
It's going to be a tough fight, but the fate of Shin Japan is at stake.
Saviours, show them your appeal!

> battle 150

We're unstoppable.
With the power of Shin Japan's greatest idols, few can stand a chance against our unit.
You /will/ be entertained. 
However, this is raw, untamed power. 
We may have conquered Japan, but the whole world is currently out of the question.
With her dying breath, one of the Budokan idols begins to speak.
### boss_4_2 enter, from left, into middle, rotated left
boss_4_2:: "You'll never make it. You don't stand a chance against the IIA".
...
...
...
boss_4_2:: "The IIA, you idiots. The International Idol Association".
She pauses briefly to cough up blood. 
boss_4_2:: "If you're to succeed, you must first defeat the three representatives of the IIA".
With that, she slumps to one side.
Thank you for your help, idol-san. Your unique flavour will never be forgotten.

# part five

## shrine_bloom

Fortunately for our heroes, it would not be long before the IIA made themselves known.
As the idols left the Budokan, the earth began to shake.
With a grand plume of fire, three masked figures appear before us.
### boss_5_2 enter, from left, into middle
boss_5_2:: "We are the IIA representatives for Asia."
### boss_5_1 enter, from left, into left
boss_5_1:: "We have been watching, and we have decided to stop you here."
### boss_5_3 enter, from right, into right
boss_5_3:: "As representatives as the IIA."
boss_5_1:: "Basically we're a big deal."
It's not clear what the IIA is, but-
boss_5_3:: "We're the..."
boss_5_1:: "International!"
boss_5_2:: "Idol!"
### celebrate
boss_5_1, boss_5_2, boss_5_3:: "Association!"
...
It appears our opponents are performing some kind of death ritual.
However, as dangerous as it may be, consuming the experiences of an idol unit of this level would prove invaluable.
We need to win now, when it really counts. Let's show them the power of Shin Japanese audio engineering!
...for the sake of the world!

> battle 200

With the IIA representatives for Asia defeated, our idols are now the strongest in the entire continent.
All of it! Even the small, boring parts.
But that's, like, not even most of the world.
Yes, legend tells of distant lands outside of Asia. Lands incomparable to Shin Japan.
America. 
Europe.
America and Europe.
Our idols can't obtain their dream of uniting the world while there are members of the IIA still around.
We must bring the fight to them.
Business suit schedules a flight, marking the beginning of our search for the European IIA representatives.

# part six

## norway_blur

Europe, the gigantic country to the west, is first on the list.
The plane journey has been largely uneventful, but I can't say the same for the in-flight meal.
The main dish of the Japanese meal is sushi. An extravagant selection of futomaki rolls with inspired ingredients.
The first pair flaunted delicate slices of lightly seasoned bluefin tuna, which mingled exquisitely with the crunchy cucumber and mildly spiced mayonnaise. 
These were followed by a modest pairing of sweet tempura shrimp and toasted sesame seeds. The crisp nori seaweed added a delicate resistance to the piece.
However, it's the final pair that will leave a lasting impression. 
The outstanding composition of fresh salmon and tender avocado, accentuated with crunchy lettuce, truly set the dish apart from all others like it.
A completely inedible offering for an idol unit that doesn't eat seafood.
Never trust a fish. These are words that the agency will live and die by.
Fortunately the disappointment will only be momentary, as the flight to Europe proves to be a short one. We have arrived.
As our idols step off the plane, the European IIA representatives step out from behind a truck.
### boss_6_2 enter, from left, into middle
boss_6_2:: "At last, we have found you. Welcome to Norway!"
### boss_6_1 enter, from left, into left
boss_6_1:: "Velkommen!"
### boss_6_3 enter, from right, into right
boss_6_3:: "Ni hao!"
The European representative's attempt to lull our heroes into a false sense of security hasn't worked.
We know we're in Europe, not Norway.
Insulted by this cheap trick, our idols prepare for combat.

> battle 250

A lot of time was wasted locating the European representatives.
With that in mind, it became imperative that the idols find the American representatives as soon as possible.
The immediacy? Well, I suppose it isn't immediate per se...
But the sooner we kill the American representatives, the sooner we can save the planet!
Kill their spirits, I mean. It's complicated.
Fortunately a plane won't be necessary, as America is easily within driving distance.
Our idols spend the journey reflecting on battles past, preparing themselves for a life of fame and entertainment.

# part seven

## western_blur

The drive was arduous.
There were mountains, rivers, and even deserts!
And they would have had to cross them if they hadn't taken the highway straight to America. 
But the traffic was awful, which put a slight dampener on the mood.
The idols that, as far as the plot so far is concerned, are second only to the American IIA representatives.
But we're here now. 
The car rolls up to a dusty saloon. 
There are horses tied up by the watering hole, and some local kids are playing music on their mobile phones.
The saloon doors swing open to reveal a trio of girls wearing cowboy hats, pistols on their hips and snarls to match the mood.
It appears that even America has cosplay idols.
"Yer done did it now, pardner" cries the leader of the unit, to the confusion of our heroes.
When the diplomatic talks with the European idols broke down, we'd hoped to at least make progress with the Americans.
But we were not prepared for them to speak such a bizarre language. The talks are off.
We must be cautious, however. This is our largest hurdle thus far.
End them, and our heroes become the strongest idol unit in the world!

> battle 300

Victory is ours!
We are the strongest idol unit in the world!
Maybe even the universe!
With the IIA defeated, we've finally achieved our dream of bringing joy to the world.
Congratulations.
The end.
Fini.
Endo.
...
What's that? The world needs to hear the idols perform?
Ah well, yeah. 
I suppose so. 
If you want.
Like, hurry up though because we've got to have celebrations and stuff.

# part eight

## large_stage_bloom

To mark the defeat of the IIA and a revolution in worldwide idoling, a grand stage has been constructed for the performance.
It comes equipped with speakers the size of small nations, just to make sure that everyone can hear the idols sing.
Living or dead.
Which is fortunate really, because three familiar-looking ghosts have approached us.
They were at least polite enough to wait until the end of the song, though.
"You must stop! You're not ready!"
"You're not strong enough!"
"Think of the children!"
Even now, the ex-leaders of the IIA representatives are doubting the abilities of our units.
It's time to end this, once and for all.

> battle 350

If there was any doubting their abilities as the world's strongest idol unit,
/they just killed three ghosts./
To celebrate this moment, we should have our idols raise their glowsticks in the air.
You know, because it seems like an idol-y thing to do.
And it might make for a good album cover or something.
...
That's right! Just like that!
Hold that pose!

# part nine

## earth_blur

Finally, my plan is complete!
With the world's strongest idols defeated, I'm free to conquer Earth.
That's right, it's me! The narrator!
You may have thought that you'd won the war, but the truth is...
/we let you win./
With the world in this depressed state, we have been free to prepare a super weapon.
One that will wipe out your planet before you can even say goodbye to it.
There's literally nothing you can do about it!
Now, I think it's time we make idols an extinct species, starting with your precious little group!

> battle 400

No! This cannot be!
Have I... Have I created a monster unit?
/The Strongest Idols in the Universe™?/
...
...
...
Ahahaha! 
Of course not.
What you defeated were simply a mass-produced alien idol unit, one of millions ready to destroy your planet.
That, and you ate them! 
Honestly, did you not think the whole cannibalism thing was a bit weird?
Anyway.
You're finished! There's nothing left that you can do! 
Come with me. 
I'll permit you to watch the end of Earth before I finish you off.

You see this? I believe you call it the sun.
It's actually our mothership!
Yep, you had no idea, did you? 
It's pretty funny really. Like, it's super obvious.
Look at it. It's a ball of fire. That's just weird.
Inside this ship is our super weapon.
That's right,
/The Strongest Idols in the Universe™./
We had them all along!
Watch in amazement as they appeal, excite and destroy you and your stupid planet!
