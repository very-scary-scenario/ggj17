The year is 20XX. Idols.
After a gruelling war against an otherworldly threat, Earth is in a state of recovery.
It's a time of reflection, repair and respite.
With a sombre mood permeating the planet, it has become the job of entertainers to lift the spirits of the populace.
This is the story of an idol unit that conquered the world.
With love.
And also music.

## office_bloom

Our unit's humble beginning is in a rundown office building, in the middle of Shin Tokyo.
People desperately need encouragement from local idols, but it helps no one if the dances are sloppy.
For this idol unit to be successful, they must first learn from the girls that came before them.
Fortunately for us, there's a local group available to teach our girls in a hands-on way.
### boss_1_2 appear middle
"What's this? Another fledgling idol group to cut down?"
"Don't waste our time!"
### clear
Charming. Anyway.
From one idol unit to the next, we can unite the world with cheer.
Which is why they must fight.

> battle 0

With the rival unit defeated, our heroes have taken their first steps towards saving the world.
Thank you, senpais.
Your spirits will live on in the new generation.

# part two

## small_stage_bloom

After learning some dance routines from the internet and squeezing in some karaoke sessions, our unit ventures into the wider world.
Their prowess has been acknowledged by their seniors, but Shin Tokyo does not yet know that their saviours have arrived.
To move forward, they must perform at local venues, slowly working their way up the idol food chain.
But in these trying times, we must all make sacrifices.
It's 6pm. The local venue, Angel Sparking Dream, is soon to open its doors for the night's performance.
There's another idol group on the cards, but we should be able to convince them to give up their spot. 
This is a chance at a big break.
One that our heroes desperately need.
Idols! Defeat the rival idol unit and claim your rightful place as the hope of Shin Tokyo.

> battle 50

The rival unit is defeated, and their dreams merge with yours.
It's quite beautiful, really. 
Even with the mess.
As the crowds filter into the venue, they seem surprised to see a different idol group on the stage.
But surprise quickly turns to acceptance, feeding our idols energy through the medium of glowstick.

# part three

## jp_alley_bloom

While leaving the venue, the idols are approached by someone in a business suit.
They seem really nice, offering to produce the up-and-coming saviours of the world. 
Not only will they help the unit perform at the Shin Nippon Budokan, the most important stage in the country,
but they'll also help with the cleaning! Score!
Seriously, when you need to remove stains from your costume's frills, you need all the help you can get.
There is a condition, however.
Our idols are introduced to another local unit managed by the producer.
To win the help of this producer, our idols must demonstrate what the opportunity means to them.
The two groups shake hands, dust down their costumes and prepare for battle.

> battle 100

With the battle won, our idols are one step closer to conquering the world.
With love, sparkles and all that good stuff.
The producer seems irritated at first that their idol unit has just been annihilated,
but concludes that the money saved on future wages was probably worth it.
With the dreams and aspirations of three rival idol units inside them, they head to the Shin Nippon Budokan. 

# part four

## budokan_glow

The producer proves to be a great asset almost immediately, gaining the unit access to the Budokan.
The guards stood no chance against a swift chop to the neck.
While our heroes are surely going to become the saviours of the world, the general populace doesn't know that yet.
So, you know. Needs must.
Chop chop. 
As our group approaches the stage, a famous idol unit slowly comes into view.
You know, /it's them/. The most popular idols in all of Shin Japan.
They aren't like the others, though. Their overwhelming presence is felt from across the corridor.
Worst still, they know why our unit is here.
The leader of the group, without breaking eye contact with our idols, removes her evening gloves and tosses them to one side.
Another pats her mouth with a tissue. It appears we're not the first to challenge them today.
That they are still hungry for battle is testament to their strength.
This is going to be a tough fight, but the fate of Shin Japan is at stake.
Show them your appeal, saviours!

> battle 150

We're unstoppable.
With the power of Shin Japan's best idols, few can stand a chance against our unit.
You /will/ be entertained. 
However, this is untamed, raw power. 
Japan may be conquered, but the whole world is currently out of the question.
With her dying breath, one of the Budokan idols begins to speak.
"You'll never make it. You don't stand a chance against the IIA".
...
...
...
"The IIA, idiots. The International Idol Association".
She pauses briefly to cough up blood. 
"If you're to succeed, you must first defeat the three representatives of the IIA".
With that, she slumps to one side.
Thank you for your help, idol-san. Your tastes will not be forgotten.

# part five

## shrine_bloom

Fortunately for our heroes, it would not be long before the IIA made themselves known.
As the idols left the Budokan, the earth began to shake.
With a grand plume of fire, three masked figures appear before us.
"We are the IIA representatives for Asia."
"We have been watching, and we have decided to stop you here."
"As representatives as the IIA."
"Basically we're a big deal."
As confusing as it may be, consuming the experiences of an idol unit of this level would prove invaluable.
Let's show them the power of Shin Japanese audio engineering!
...for the sake of the world!

> battle 200

With the IIA representatives for Asia defeated, our idols are now the strongest in the entire continent.
All of it! Even the small, boring parts.
But that's, like, not even most of the world.
Yes, legend tells of distant lands outside of Asia. Lands incomparable to Shin Japan.
America. Europe.
Europe, a gigantic country to the west, is first on the list.
The producer schedules a flight, marking the beginning of our search for the European IIA representatives.

# part six

## norway_blur

As our idols step off the plane, the European IIA representatives step out from behind a truck.
"At last, we have found you. Welcome to Norway!"
The European representative's attempt to lull our heroes into a false sense of security hasn't worked.
We know we're in Europe, not Norway.
Insulted by this cheap trick, they prepare for combat.

> battle 250

A lot of time was wasted locating the European representatives.
With that in mind, it became imperative that the idols find the American representatives as soon as possible.
The immediacy? Well, I suppose it isn't immediate per se...
But the sooner we kill the American representatives, the sooner we can save the planet!
Kill their spirits, I mean. It's complicated.
Fortunately a plane won't be necessary, as America is easily within driving distance.
Our idols spend the journey reflecting on battles past, preparing themselves for a life of fame and entertainment.

# part seven

## western_blur

The drive was arduous.
There were mountains, rivers, and even deserts!
And they would have had to cross them if they hadn't taken the highway straight to America. 
But the traffic was awful, which put a slight dampener on the mood.
The idols that, as far as the plot so far is concerned, are second only to the American IIA representatives.
But we're here now. 
The car rolls up to a dusty saloon. 
There are horses tied up by the watering hole, and some local kids are playing music on their mobile phones.
The saloon doors swing open to reveal a trio of girls wearing cowboy hats, pistols on their hips and snarls to match the mood.
It appears that even America has cosplay idols.
"Yer done did it now, pardner" cries the leader of the unit, to the confusion of our heroes.
When the diplomatic talks with the European idols broke down, we'd hoped to at least make progress with the Americans.
But we were not prepared for them to speak such a bizarre language. The talks are off.
We must be cautious, however. This is our largest hurdle thus far.
End them, and our heroes become the strongest idol unit in the world!

> battle 300

Victory is ours!
We are the strongest idol unit in the world!
Maybe even the universe!
With the IIA defeated, we've finally achieved our dream of bringing joy to the world.
Congratulations.
The end.
Fini.
Endo.
...
What's that? The world needs to hear the idols perform?
Ah well, yeah. 
I suppose so. 
If you want.
Like, hurry up though because we've got to have celebrations and stuff.

# part eight

## large_stage_bloom

To mark the defeat of the IIA and a revolution in worldwide idoling, a grand stage has been constructed for the performance.
It comes equipped with speakers the size of small nations, just to make sure that everyone can hear the idols sing.
Living or dead.
Which is fortunate really, because three familiar-looking ghosts have approached us.
They were at least polite enough to wait until the end of the song, though.
"You must stop! You're not ready!"
"You're not strong enough!"
"Think of the children!"
Even now, the ex-leaders of the IIA representatives are doubting the abilities of our units.
It's time to end this, once and for all.

> battle 350

If there was any doubting their abilities as the world's strongest idol unit,
/they just killed three ghosts/.
To celebrate this moment, we should have our idols raise their glowsticks in the air.
You know, because it seems like an idol-y thing to do.
And it might make for a good album cover or something.
...
That's right! Just like that!
Hold that pose!

# part nine

## earth_blur

Finally, my plan is complete!
With the world's strongest idols defeated, I'm free to conquer Earth.
That's right, it's me! The narrator!
You may have thought that you'd won the war, but the truth is...
/we let you win/.
With the world in this depressed state, we have been free to prepare a super weapon.
One that will wipe out your planet before you can even say goodbye to it.
There's literally nothing you can do about it!
Now, I think it's time we make idols an extinct species, starting with your precious little group!

> battle 400

No! This cannot be!
Have I... Have I created a monster unit?
/The Strongest Idols in the Universe™/?
...
...
...
Ahahaha! 
Of course not.
What you defeated were simply a mass-produced alien idol unit, one of millions ready to destroy your planet.
That, and you ate them! 
Honestly, did you not think the whole cannibalism thing was a bit weird?
Anyway.
You're finished! There's nothing left that you can do! 
Come with me. 
I'll permit you to watch the end of Earth before I finish you off.

# part ten

## sun_glow

You see this? I believe you call it the sun.
It's actually our mothership!
Yep, you had no idea, did you? 
It's pretty funny really. Like, it's super obvious.
Look at it. It's a ball of fire. That's just weird.
Inside this ship is our super weapon.
That's right,
/The Strongest Idols in the Universe™/.
We had them all along!
Watch in amazement as they appeal, excite and destroy you and your stupid planet!

The alien threat was thwarted for a second time
and the Earth saw a brief period of peace
before everyone died when the sun was flown back to its home planet.
The end.
